    s.description  = <<-DESC
    XWebView is an extensible WebView which is built on top of WKWebView,
    the modern WebKit framework debuted in iOS 8.0. It provides fast Web
    runtime with carefully designed plugin API for developing sophisticated
    iOS native or hybrid applications.
    
    Plugins written in Objective-C or Swift programming language can be
    automatically exposed in JavaScript context. With capabilities offered
    by plugins, Web apps can look and behave exactly like native apps. They
    will be no longer a second-class citizen on iOS platform.
